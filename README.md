# Radical Red Rom Hack Pokedex

Welcome to the documentation for the Radical Red Rom Hack Pokedex. This project was built with passion to improve the existing Pokedex available at [dex.radicalred.net](https://dex.radicalred.net) and add extra search functionality.

## Features

- Comprehensive Pokémon database for Radical Red Rom Hack
- Advanced search functionality by name, move, ability, and type
- Clean and minimal design with dark mode support
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices

## Getting Started

To get started with our Pokedex, please navigate through the sections using the sections dropdown menu. Here are some key features to explore:

- **Search Pokémon**: Find Pokémon by name, move, ability, or type
- **View Details**: Get comprehensive information about each Pokémon
- **Filter Moves**: Filter moves by type, category, and more
- **Filter Abilities**: Filter abilities by generation and category
- **(Coming Soon) Compare Stats**: Compare different Pokémon side by side

> **Note on Performance**: A lot of data is being loaded in, so some load times may vary. This will improve over time as we implement different optimization techniques.

## Data Sources

All data was collected through web scraping and by modifying existing data sets. The quality and accuracy of the data will continue to improve over time as I refine the collection methods and sources.

## Development Status

This project was built over a few days and is still under active development. I will do my best to improve and add new features rapidly. The API will be improving over time, and new features will be added based on user feedback and requests.
